AcilOkeyApp is a project for Human Computer Interaction Course at İzmir Institute of Technology (CENG318).

We are not designing for people who already play regularly or those who have no interest in playing. 
Our focus is on those who would play more — if only they had someone to play with.

Here is our marketing research - user profile analysis:
Total responses: 76
Play frequency:
45: Yearly
23: Monthly
6: Never
2: Daily
Would play more if they had friends?
Yes: 42

Would use the app?
Yes: 32
No: 44
High-potential target group: ~19 users (25%)
→ Users who play, want to play more if they had friends, and would use an app.
